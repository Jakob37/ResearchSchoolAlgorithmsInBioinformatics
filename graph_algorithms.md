# Graphs

## What are the elements of graphs?

* Points - nodes representing the elements
* Lines - edges linking the elements together in different ways

## What is a "digraph"?

Where edges have directions connected with them.

## What is meant by a "weighted graph"?

Where edges are given numerical weight.

## Explain the following graph concepts:

* Path - Finite or infinite sequences of edges connecting different nodes. A way between one node and another.
* Cycle - A closed path, where the path is looping back to an original node
* Subgraph - A subset of a full graph
* Bipartite - When decomposing a graph into two subsets where no edges directly connect nodes within a subset
* Matching - A set of edges in graph without any common nodes
* Clique - Subset of nodes in undirected graph so that if picking any two nodes within the clique, they are directly linked with an edge
* Independent set - A set of nodes where no nodes is directly connecting them

## What is a minimum spanning tree?

## What is an Euler cycle?

## What is a Hamiltonian cycle?

# Graph algorithms

## Graph traversal, what is:

* Depth-first search?
* Breadth-first search?

## What problem is the Kruskal's algorithm for?

## What is the Travelling salesman problem?

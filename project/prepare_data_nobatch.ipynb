    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating base-FASTA with intensities\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose with this notebook is to generate a simulated proteomics label-free quantification dataset. This is done by first generating a FASTA-file with headers in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">sp|P75925|C56I_ECOLI [# intensity=974548.6052639355 #]\n",
    "MSFTNTPERYGVISAAFHWLSAIIVYGMFALGLWMVTLSYYDGWYHKAPELHKSIGILLM\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The FASTA is generated from two separate FASTA files where entries in the first is used as background while entries from the second is used as spike-in. The script `lfqtk.py generat_spikein_set` varies intensities on features on the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A base-line intensity is set (on protein level)\n",
    "* For the spike-in data intensities are set based on the base intensity times a sample-specific fold change\n",
    "* The batch effect is applied as a constant intensity shift for all proteins in particular samples\n",
    "* A random noise factor is applied\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is performed on protein level intensities will be varying between peptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulating and quantifying the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation of the data is performed using the OpenMS tool `MSSimulator`. The simulation is performed using default settings and output is received in `featureXML` format. The features in this files are linked to the identities of the entries used to generate the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantification is performed using the OpenMS tool `ProteinQuantifier`, which is ran with default settings. Quantification is only performed on peptide level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating intensity matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to merge the resulting tab-delimited files from the quantification step to a matrix representing the intensities for each peptide/sample. This is performed with a custom script `combine_quant_pd.py` which simply links intensities from identical peptide + protein identification. This is reasonable here as we know that the identifications are correct and unique from the simulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, the following dependencies are required. For demonstration purposes, resulting data files are included in the repository meaning that the analysis itself can be tested independently without running through this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* OpenMS binaries in PATH (version 2.2.0)\n",
    "* Jupyter Bash kernel (https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel)\n",
    "* GNU parallel (https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)"
